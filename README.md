## Exam School Review

> Exam schools are selective public high schools that aim to meet the needs of academically talented students. Not charter schools and not private schools, these selective public schools accept new students based on studentâ€™s grades and entrance exam scores.

The site aims to provide reviews and ratings of exam schools so that parents and students can make informed decision. [Source](http://learninglab.legacy.wbur.org/topics/exam-schools-achievement-and-isee-entrance-exams/)
